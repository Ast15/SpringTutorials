# SpringTutorials [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fishercoder1534/SpringTutorials.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fishercoder1534/SpringTutorials)

This is a Maven managed project, so just fire up your IntelliJ/Eclipse and open this project as a Maven project, then your IDE will smile. ^ ^
It saves you from all of the depedency management hassel as it saves me from downloading/managing all those Spring/Commons/Logging jars and put them on my classpath.
